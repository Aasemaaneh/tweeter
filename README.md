## Introduction

Tweeter is a fun project where students can practice their HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery, and AJAX front-end skills, as well as their Node.js and Express.js back-end skills. It allows users to compose short tweets and view them in a feed. The project provides a starting codebase that students can build upon and expand to create a fully functional Twitter-like application.
